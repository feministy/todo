#### Get it done.

Using Object-Oriented design principles to build a command to do list program that reads from various file types and saves as well. This little baby app serves as practice for me to become better at parsing and saving to/from various file types, as well as general OO design. It's definitely not necessary to cover as many file types as I plan, but it's still good practice :)
